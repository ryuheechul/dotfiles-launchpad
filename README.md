# dotfiles launchpad

This repository is to:
- demonstrate examples of bootstrapping of [dotfiles](https://github.com/ryuheechul/dotfiles)
- test its usability
- package it into a useful form (like a docker image)

## Test with vagrant

```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
zsh

# and enjoy all the packages and configuration that's prepared by `dotfiles`
# such as tmux, nvim with spacevim, lf
```

clean up with `vagrant destroy`
